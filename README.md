# Twitch Clone with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Livekit SDK, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Clerk

This is a project aiming to create a Twitch-like platform for streaming video games using the latest technologies such as Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Livekit SDK for streaming, Prisma as the ORM, PostgreSQL for the database, and Clerk as the authentication provider.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitch-clone.git
cd twitch-clone
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Now, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. You can start editing the pages by modifying files in the `app` directory. The project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font.
